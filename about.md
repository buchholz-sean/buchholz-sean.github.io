Raised in the Midwest, Sean became interested in web design in the late 1990s when his family got their first home computer (a Gateway with a 10GB HDD and processor speed measured in MHz). Since then, his interest has waxed and waned, but really reignited some time around 2011 when Responsive Web Design was starting to become an industry buzzword.

Beyond web design, he loves all kinds of art and performance. He draws, paints, and has played guitar for nearly two decades. His presence is tolerated by his wife, son, and three remarkably obnoxious cats.

  The anticipated research and project topics for Week 1
---

By the end of Week 1, I will have researched the Agile Project Management phase called _Envision_.

I will also learn how to use a MEAN Stack for ecommerce using NodeJS + Express and the Pug templating engine, along with MongoDB and Mongoose for database integration. Through continuous individual research I will also be learning how to implement Product Ratings as a unique solo contribution to my ecommerce project. This will allow users to rank products and see collected aggregate ratings.

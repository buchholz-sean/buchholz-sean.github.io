  The anticipated research and project topics for Week 3
---

By the end of Week 3, I will have researched the Agile Project Management phase called _Explore & Adapt_.

I will also have completed a second prototype of my ecommerce project, with good MVC layer separation in place. I will also have conducted research on Node, Agile Project Management philosophy, and Git syntax.

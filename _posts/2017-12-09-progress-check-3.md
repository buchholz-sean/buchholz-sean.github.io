Agile Life Cycle
{:.lead}

The Explore phase of the Agile Project Management life cycle&mdash;the point at which my team is currently&mdash;is the phase during which the team begins to produce deliverables for the client. In our specific example, Daniel and I have begun to flesh out the scaffold of code largely provided to us by the Academind tutorials. This is the point during which development teams on Agile projects would begin to implement code sprints, working to complete a feature or handful of features at a time, then presenting those to the client for feedback, which carries the team forward into the Adapt phase as well.

So far I feel I have learned a lot from the Academind tutorial videos. It has been a bit of a struggle to understand the exact implementation of some of the packages he's been using and their built-in methods, but in general he has done a good job of explaining what features he's using and how and why they work the way they do. Many of the features in this project have been requirements in previous course assignments as well, but in those instances students were largely required to hand-code the features rather than make use of Node.JS or other packages.

His custom user login verification middleware was a simple but elegantly executed solution to a problem I hadn't even considered. Similarly, his use of conditionals in the view layer as a sort of secondary controller, though not a new technique to me, is a good refresher regarding the power of these Server-Side frameworks and how they interface with the UI layer. My team is using the built-in Pug templating engine instead of Handlebars, but the core concepts remain the same, and it has been a fun challenge figuring out how to implement the same functionality in a different language.

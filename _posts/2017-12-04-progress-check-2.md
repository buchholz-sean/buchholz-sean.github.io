Agile Life Cycle

The Speculate and Explore phases of the APM allow project managers to ensure that team members have a strong understanding of the work expected by the client before advancing with actual development. In the Speculate phase, team members come up with "user stories" to flesh out potential use cases of the project, which helps to ensure that the scope of work is accurate and adequate to cover the client's expectations. User Stories also help a team find any features or functionality that might have been overlooked in the initial features list. The Explore phase allows the team to develop iteratively and continuously deliver components and portions of the project while investigating alternative solutions to the problems presented in the Speculate phase.

The Academind developer videos have continued to be a fantastic resource as my team pushes forward with development on the WD6i shopping cart project. The custom routing middleware demonstration helped to underscore the fact that writing middleware doesn't need to be complex or confusing. He also took a work-smarter-not-harder approach to both client-side and server-side validation on the user login functionality in his project, and he demonstrated the NPM Bcrypt package which allows for secure hashing and salting of user passwords. In all, his techniques have been interesting to watch come together on the screen, even though his development style is very straightforward and uncomplicated. I appreciate that both frameworks he has chosen to demonstrate&mdash;Laravel and Express&mdash;allow for fairly minimal code while optimizing output.

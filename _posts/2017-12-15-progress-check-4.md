Agile Life Cycle
{:.lead}

The final phase, following the Explore/Adapt cycle, is the Close phase. In this phase of the APM life cycle, team members review all of the project deliverables for suitability before final turnover to the client. Additionally, after the project is finished, team members review performance to uncover challenges and pain points that can help inform and improve overall performance in future projects. This can be a great time to reflect on individual team members strengths and weaknesses, and to perform individual and team-wide SWOT assessments.

LAMP & MEAN
{:.lead}

This week, the Academind tutorial videos mostly covered finishing touches and polish for the eCommerce shopping cart application. As such, the differences between the LAMP and MEAN stack videos were primarily due to minor differences in the way the two framework technologies handle methods and passing information through the MVC architecture. I appreciate the wrap-up and how the developer tied the whole application together. In our team project, we had to make some minor updates to the application to account for updates to Bootstrap as well as changes to the Stripe payment API.

Overall, our team performance might have been improved if we had separated concerns more cleanly; i.e. if one of us had handled all the models and routing, and the other had handled strictly views and styling. As it was, with two developers trying to follow along with a solo developer's tutorials, we encountered a number of conflicts when pushing commits from feature branches into the development branch of our GitHub repository.

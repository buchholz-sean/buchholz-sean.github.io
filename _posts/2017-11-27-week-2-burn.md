  The anticipated research and project topics for Week 2
---

By the end of Week 2, I will have researched the Agile Project Management phase called _Speculate_.

I will also learn how to create product feature lists and UX flowcharts for delivery to a client. This will help streamline the development process by defining scope of work and allow for good scheduling practices. By this point I will also have a functioning prototype of my ecommerce project.

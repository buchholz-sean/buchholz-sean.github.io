  The anticipated research and project topics for Week 4
---

By the end of Week 4, I will have researched the Agile Project Management phase called _Adapt/Close_.

I will also have a final functioning prototype of my ecommerce project, with all functionality in place. This will include database integration, Stripe API integration, and my unique solo contribution of product ratings.

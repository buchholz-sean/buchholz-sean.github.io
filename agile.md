## Envision

The Envision phase is the first phase of an Agile project. During this phase, project team members collaborate and develop a "vision" for the client's project. At this point, some of the key project information is fleshed out, like expected features and capabilities, overall work scope and schedule, and possibly other elements and components like branding and marketing strategy. This is the _planning_ portion of the project life cycle, before any actual coding or development work takes place.

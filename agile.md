## Envision

The Envision phase is the first phase of an Agile project. During this phase, project team members collaborate and develop a "vision" for the client's project. At this point, some of the key project information is fleshed out, like expected features and capabilities, overall work scope and schedule, and possibly other elements and components like branding and marketing strategy. This is the _planning_ portion of the project life cycle, before any actual coding or development work takes place.

## Speculate

The Speculate phase is the point at which the development team begins to flesh out specific features and use cases, most frequently by creating "user stories" that simulate real-world situations. In this phase, team members might begin to examine the scope of the project and ensure that the user stories and scope of work line up with the client's expectations. Like all the phases of the APM philosophy, the Speculate phase relies heavily on teamwork and collaboration to get a broad range of ideas onto the table and ready for possible future implementation.

## Explore & Adapt

The Explore phase of an Agile project is when initial product deliveries begin to take place. During this step, team members develop alternative solutions to the problems and user stories discovered in the earlier phases. Likewise, the Adapt phase is the time during which the team takes feedback from the client and begins to implement that feedback into the deliverables as well.
